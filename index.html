<!-- The second project requires us to create a trading card based off the design prototype that was given to us. -->
<!-- For this project I used the developer tools that you can find by inspecting a web page a lot more often than I've ever done before. -->
<!-- It was pretty satisfying that I was able to "debug" a lot of my code simply by looking deep into the probelms that I came across while creating this web page -->
<!-- Padding was new to me, and was required for this assignment with very little explanation.  However, I did overcome the firsthand complexity of it and feel confident about it now -->
<!-- Additionally, although not required, I personally used Photoshop to create my own image instead of using the given image to practice implementing Photoshop into Front-End. -->
